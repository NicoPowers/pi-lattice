Devcontainer setup complete.

Start Pi from this container with:
  pi

Then enable the orchestrator with:
  /orchestrate
  /dashboard

This is a local-path Pi package install. Edits in this checkout are the installed package;
use /reload or restart Pi after extension changes, and run `bun run build` after dashboard changes.
