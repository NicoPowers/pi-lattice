# pi-agent-orchestrator — Development Roadmap

## Architecture Overview

Multi-agent orchestration extension for Pi. The orchestrator (broker LLM in your interactive Pi session) spawns specialized sub-agents, each running in an isolated `bwrap` sandbox with a shared git worktree per issue.

### Key Concepts

- **Root agent**: `parent: "self"`. Gets its own `git worktree`.
- **Sub-agent**: `parent: "<some-agent>"`. Shares the parent's worktree (same bwrap `/workspace`).
- **Broker extension**: TypeScript extension in the orchestrator's Pi session. Holds all agent pipes, routes messages.
- **Async messaging**: `agent_send` returns immediately. Results delivered to orchestrator via `sendUserMessage({deliverAs: "steer"})`.
- **Delegation chain**: Sub-agents call a `delegate` tool. Broker extension routes through parent chain.

## Completed

### Issue 1: Bwrap + Shared Worktree Per Root Agent ✅

**Status**: Implemented, committed, tested and fixed.

**What works:**
- `agent_spawn` creates root agents with `git worktree add <path> HEAD`
- Sub-agents reuse parent's worktree
- Every agent spawned inside `bwrap`:
  ```
  bwrap --ro-bind / / --tmpfs /tmp --bind <worktree> /tmp/workspace --chdir /tmp/workspace --share-net pi --mode rpc ...
  ```
- Prompts written into worktree at `/tmp/workspace/.pi/prompts/<name>.md`
- Comms directory created: `/tmp/workspace/.pi/comms/{requests,responses}/`
- Orphaned worktree cleanup on startup (`cleanupOrphanedWorktrees`)
- Worktree removal on `agent_kill` (root) and `session_shutdown`
- Serialized worktree creation with mutex (`worktreeLock`)
- `hasBwrap()` detection using `spawnSync("which", ["bwrap"])`

**Bugs fixed:**
- `spawn.sync` → `spawnSync` (Node API difference)
- `bwrap: Can't mkdir /workspace: Read-only file system` — changed sandbox mount from `/workspace` to `/tmp/workspace` so bwrap can create the mount point inside the writable `/tmp` tmpfs
- `/spawn` command now validates the agent actually stayed alive after spawn (was falsely reporting success when the process exited immediately)
- Added writable bind for `~/.pi/agent` so child pi processes can create lock files

**Test command:**
```
# Must be run inside a git repo (not ~/.pi/)
/spawn lead self coder
/ask lead "Create a file called hello.txt with 'hello world'"
```

**Verify:**
```bash
# Check worktree exists
ls -la /tmp/pi-worktree-lead-*

# Check file was created inside bwrap
cat /tmp/pi-worktree-lead-*/hello.txt
```

## Completed

### Issue 2: Async `agent_send` ✅

**Status**: Implemented and tested.

**What changed:**
- `agent_send` tool now returns immediately with `"Queued task for 'lead'. Result will be delivered when the agent completes."`
- Background `Promise.resolve().then(...)` fires `sendToAgent` asynchronously
- When the agent responds, the extension calls:
  ```ts
  pi.sendUserMessage(`[${name}] ${result}`, { deliverAs: "steer" })
  ```
- Orchestrator receives the result as a new steering message after its current turn finishes
- Pending tasks are tracked in a `Map<string, PendingTask>` for observability
- `/ask` command stays blocking (user-facing direct interaction)

**Tested:**
```
agent_send("lead", "write async-test.txt with 'async works' and cat it")
→ Returns immediately: "Queued task for 'lead'..."
→ User can chat with orchestrator while lead works
→ [lead] result delivered as steering message when complete
```

## Pending Issues

### Issue 3: Per-Agent `delegate` Extension ✅

**Status**: Implemented and tested.

**What changed:**
- Created `extensions/delegate-agent.ts` — registers a `delegate` tool inside each sub-agent
- Tool writes request to `/tmp/workspace/.pi/comms/requests/<toolCallId>.json`
- Polls for response at `/tmp/workspace/.pi/comms/responses/<toolCallId>.json`
- Returns response text when broker writes the result file

### Issue 4: Broker Extension Routes `delegate` Requests ✅

**Status**: Implemented and tested.

**What changed:**
- Broker extension monitors JSONL stdout for `tool_execution_start` with `toolName: "delegate"`
- Reads request file from shared worktree, looks up target agent in `agents` map
- Calls `sendToAgent(targetAgent, task)` and writes result back to responses file
- Original agent's `delegate` tool unblocks and continues with the routed result

**Spawn integration:**
- `delegate-agent.ts` copied into worktree `.pi/extensions/` before each spawn
- Sub-agents launched with `--no-extensions --extension /tmp/workspace/.pi/extensions/delegate-agent.ts`
- `package.json` changed to only auto-load `multi-agent.ts` (prevents delegate loading in orchestrator)

**Tested:**
```
/spawn lead self coder
/spawn scout lead coder
/ask lead "Delegate to scout to list all files, then summarize"
→ Lead calls delegate("scout", "list all files...")
→ Broker routes to scout
→ Scout responds with file list
→ Lead gets result back and summarizes
```

---

### Issue 5: End-to-End MVP 🔄

**Goal**: Orchestrator → Lead → Scout → Lead → Orchestrator works end-to-end.

**Status**: Ready for testing.

**Test scenario**:
```
# 1. Spawn agents
/spawn lead self coder
/spawn scout lead reviewer

# 2. Send async task to lead
agent_send("lead", "Find auth bugs. Use @scout if needed.")
  → Returns immediately: "Queued task for 'lead'..."

# 3. [Background] Lead delegates multiple times
Lead calls delegate("scout", "Find all auth-related code")
  → Broker routes to Scout
  → Scout responds with findings
  → Broker writes response, Lead continues
Lead calls delegate("scout", "Check src/login.js for SQL injection")
  → Same cycle...
Lead gives final: "Found 2 issues. Details: ..."

# 4. Result delivered to Orchestrator
→ [lead] Found 2 issues. Details: ...
```

**What to verify:**
- Multiple delegate calls in a single agent turn work correctly
- Scout (reviewer type) uses read-only tools as configured
- Lead synthesizes multiple delegate responses into final answer
- Async result delivered back to orchestrator via steering message

## Architectural Decisions Log

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| One worktree per root agent | All sub-agents share filesystem. Scout writes analysis.md, Lead reads it. No text-snippet relay needed. |
| Separate bwrap per agent | Full context isolation. Broker can kill any agent directly. TUI visibility. |
| `--ro-bind / /` + `--tmpfs /tmp` | Simple, robust. Agents can read host FS but can't write outside worktree. |
| Broker extension as message router | Broker LLM is unburdened. All relay happens in TypeScript. Full logging. |
| `agent_send` async, `delegate` blocking | Orchestrator stays interactive. Sub-agents complete their reasoning in one turn. |
| `"self"` for root parent | Explicit. No magic defaults. |

---

## Known Limitations / Future Work

- **No team support yet**: Deferred in favor of parent-child hierarchy
- **No health checking**: `agent_status` shows status but no staleness detection
- **No logs inspection**: Communication logs not yet written to disk
- **No PR/push**: Agents are read-write-local only
- **WSL not tested**: Bwrap requires WSL2 (Linux kernel)

---

## How to Resume

1. `cd` into a **git repository** (not `~/.pi/`)
2. Start `pi`
3. `/reload` to load the extension
4. Spawn agents: `/spawn lead self coder`, `/spawn scout lead reviewer`
5. Test async delegation: `agent_send("lead", "Find auth bugs. Use @scout if needed.")`
